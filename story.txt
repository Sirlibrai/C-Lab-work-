Once upon a time, there were three little
computers called linux00, linux01 and linux02.
One day, the nice computer manager came into
the Linux Laboratory. "Hello nice computer
manager," said linux00. "Hello linux00," said
the nice computer manager. "What brings you
here to see us?" said linux01. "Well," said the
nice computer manager, "I've got bad news and
I've got good news." "What's the bad news?" said
linux02. "You're all going to be unplugged," said
the nice computer manager. "What's the
goooooooooooo..." said linux00.
